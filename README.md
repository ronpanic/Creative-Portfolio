# Creative Portfolio
Portfolio implemented in a chat

I have 2 Portfolios, but the idea occurred to me to make a Portfolio inside as if it were a chat such as: Whatsapp, Discord, etc.

I found it very interesting since it comes out of the traditional Portfolios that most of us usually do (I also have my other traditional Portfolio)

I started this work around 08/20/23, that is, 9 days ago, I have a long way to go to finish it:

 • Improvements
 • Fixes 
 • Add more chats with projects
 • These days i add the change between languages ​​of Spanish and English

 Since I'm still at school sometimes I don't have time to keep updating it every day, but I try to make several changes during the week to move forward.
